## Creating my portfolio for my future employer.

---Overview
Creating my own personal portfolio from scratch to demonstrate my skills and abilities for my future employer.

### Challenge
A company has given me a mockup portfolio demonstrating my strong qualities as a future full-stack web developer. 
Given the objective, I have created my portfolio from scratch from the knowledge I have acrued. 

### User Story
"AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position"

### Acceptance Critera
"GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport"

## My Process/### What I learned
Coming from no prior coding experience, creating my portfolio was quite a challenge.
However, with time and dedication, I was able to create my portfolio and gain knowledge while doing so.
Insepecting numerous different websites allows me to see how I would like for my portfolio to display. 
Coding on my own time helped my develop both my html and CSS understanding.
